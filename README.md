> [!NOTE]
> If the graph is not saved the app will ask if you want to save your changes before discarding.

##
The 'Raw' menu contains your entire current graph data, it is exactly what is saved inside a graph file as text, you can opt to copy the contents directly from here if you want.

> [!NOTE]
> The graph is not editable from the 'Raw' menu yet.
